# proof_grabber
Script for grabbing all the selected proof photos from a Word Press proof gallery and formats the filenames into Lightroom format

Run the script, enter the URL for your proof gallery, and it will grab all the photos the client has selected, tell you how many, and format a list which you can paste into Lightroom under the "Text", "Filename", "Contains" field in the Library.
